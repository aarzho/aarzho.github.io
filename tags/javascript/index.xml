      <description>&lt;p&gt;The coding interviews / coding challenges are designed to assess how productive someone can be with the language. In contrast to the algorithm whiteboarding interview, which assesses how the candidate go about solving a problem, or the architecture design interview, which assesses how the candidate&amp;rsquo;s experience in system engineering and product design, the coding interview is is utilized by the company interviewing you to answer one question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you be productive with JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Structure with JavaScript Object: Linked List</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linked list is like an array but more flexible. Elements in an array are stored contiguously in memory while linked lists are stored as nodes with two fields: current value and a pointer to the next thing in the list. We are going to implement linked list in JavaScript and go over some algorithms with the linked list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to go over a set of coding and whiteboard problems that would be asked during a coding interview. I&amp;rsquo;m drawing these problems from &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/&#34;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=2E72V7DJM4CV4DNTBTKD&#34;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;. They are a sample of the medium and hard problems that require a bit of thinking and and familiarity with some fundamental data structures in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Single Page Application For Work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I work at my federal job on a close intranet network, we often had to access information from different databases and filesystems through custom or share point websites which did not have the best user interface. It was a pain point for me and many of my colleagues. I decided to make a set of single page applications (SPAs) with nicer UX for querying the databases and file systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
